# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: git stands for global information technology, which was created a to store data. Austin also has a unique name for it. I am assuming the difference between git and Github is that the hub has a UI attached to it.

  Researched answer: Git is used primarily from terminal or a command line, while Github is provides a website that allows interaction through an interface instead of just a terminal. There are additional tools added into Github that improves the ease of access to a repository.



2. What types of evaluations will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: True and False evaluations, which is also 1 or 0.

  Researched answer: Any evaluation that has the potential for a yes or no output



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is a number, while a value can hold different qualities.

  Researched answer: An index is the position in a string related to a numerical value. Values can relate to strings, numbers, and floats.



4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer: Built-in methods are previously coded commands that grant ease of use for programmers to simplify their algorithms.

  Researched answer: Built-in methods can be strings, math, dates, and arrays that have been created by previous developers to expedite the coding process for others. Without these we would have to code out every single command from scratch.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: The driver is responsible for typing out the code, while the navigator ensures proper execution and research of the code. Basically the driver is listening to the guidelines of the navigator in order to reduce the mental workload on each individual.

  Researched answer: It is mores simply suppose to be the driver types as the navigator reviews the code as they progress.



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: I loved the guest lecture and find all of the lectures more helpful than your average classroom experience. The paired programming and ease of access to ask questions during our problem solving allows for a very quick learning experience. More practice with Github may be helpful since the importance of it is so heavily stressed.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Iteration: The process of repeating an algorithm until the outcome is satisfactory.

2. Higher Order Functions: Higher order functions require a previously implemented function to be input and they also return a function.

3. Jest: It is a testing framework that basically acts as a spell checker or quality checker for javascript code.

4. Objects: An object is an individual piece of information that can have numerous qualities to it. Everything is an object in Javascript because it is an object-based language.

5. Classes: It seems like classes are the bag for creating and holding objects. They include code that is able to work on objects.
